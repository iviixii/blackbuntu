# Blackbuntu BB03 - Styles Archive

I'm backing up these files for nostalgic purposes. Includes the following
* Classic wallpaper
* Gtk themes
* Icons

## Terminal theme:
* Is just vintage rxvt colors with the following foreground:
`"foreground": "#008AFF",`

## TODOs:
* One day I would like to restore these gtk2 themes to there gtk3 or 4 variants
* Update the icon set to include modern apps
